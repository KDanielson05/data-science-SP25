*Background*: [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/about-gapminder/) is an independent organization that seeks to educate people about the state of the world. They seek to counteract the worldview constructed by a hype-driven media cycle, and promote a "fact-based worldview" by focusing on data. The dataset we'll study in this challenge is from Gapminder.

# Guided EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

First, we'll go through a round of *guided EDA*. Try to pay attention to the high-level process we're going through---after this guided round you'll be responsible for doing another cycle of EDA on your own!

### **q0** Perform your "first checks" on the dataset. What variables are in this dataset?

```{r q0-task}
## TASK: Do your "first checks" here!
glimpse(gapminder)

gapminder %>% 
  distinct(country)

gapminder %>% 
  distinct(continent)

gapminder %>% 
  distinct(year)

gapminder %>% 
  summarize( 
    min_lifeExp = min(lifeExp),
    max_lifeExp = max(lifeExp)
  )

gapminder %>% 
  summarize( 
    min_pop = min(pop),
    max_pop = max(pop)
  )
  

gapminder %>% 
  summarize( 
    min_gdpPercap = min(gdpPercap),
    max_gdpPercap = max(gdpPercap)
  )
```

**Observations**:

-   `Country`: this follows an alphabetized list of different countries. A country can be repeated many times as it follows a different `year`, and thus different `lifeExp`, `pop` and `gdpPercap`. For example, some countries include Afghanistan, Australia, Austria, Bahrain and more. There are a total of 142 distinct different countries that this focuses on.
-   `Continent`: This lists the continent that the prior `country` falls into. There are five different continents that countries can fall under: Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, Americas. In this dataset, there is no tracking of Antarctica and it lumps both North and South America together.
-   `Year:` This lists the year when the data for `lifeExp`, `pop` and `gdpPercap` was collected in each `country`. These years range from 1952 to 2007 in five year increments, meaning that there are 12 total distinct years.
-   `lifeExp`: This lists the current life expectancy, or the average age someone will live to in a specific country. This is dependent on the country and the year. This expectancy ranges from 23.599 to 82.603 between different countries and different years, and is largely variable.
-   `pop`: This tells the population of a given country at a given year. This data ranges from the smallest population being 60,011 to 1,318,683,096.
-   `gpdPercap`: This is the GRP (gross domestic product) generated per capita. That means this is directly dependent on the population size and the GDP generated yearly. This ranges from 241.1659 to 113,523.1.

### **q1** Determine the most and least recent years in the `gapminder` dataset.

*Hint*: Use the `pull()` function to get a vector out of a tibble. (Rather than the `$` notation of base R.)

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Find the largest and smallest values of `year` in `gapminder`
year_max <- 
  gapminder %>% 
  pull(year) %>% 
  max()
year_min <- 
  gapminder %>% 
  pull(year) %>% 
  min()
```

Use the following test to check your work.

```{r q1-tests}
## NOTE: No need to change this
assertthat::assert_that(year_max %% 7 == 5)
assertthat::assert_that(year_max %% 3 == 0)
assertthat::assert_that(year_min %% 7 == 6)
assertthat::assert_that(year_min %% 3 == 2)

if (is_tibble(year_max)) {
  print("year_max is a tibble; try using `pull()` to get a vector")
  assertthat::assert_that(False)
}

print("Nice!")
```

### **q2** Filter on years matching `year_min`, and make a plot of the GDP per capita against continent. Choose an appropriate `geom_` to visualize the data. What observations can you make?

You may encounter difficulties in visualizing these data; if so document your challenges and attempt to produce the most informative visual you can.

```{r q2-task}
## TASK: Create a visual of gdpPercap vs continent
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == year_min) %>% 
  mutate(continent = fct_reorder(continent, gdpPercap)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "GDP Per Capita vs. Continent")
```

```{r}
##Additonal analysis on the number of countries per each continent
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Oceania") %>% 
  distinct(country)
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Africa") %>% 
  distinct(country)
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>% 
  distinct(country)
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Americas") %>% 
  distinct(country)
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Europe") %>% 
  distinct(country)

```

**Observations**:

-   For continental trends, disregarding the outliers, Africa has the lowest median `gdpPercap`, then Asia, then the Americas, then Europe, and Oceania has the highest median `gdpPercap` of a continent. However, while Oceania has the highest median `gdpPercap` of a continent, it does not hold the countries with the highest `gdpPercap`. Rather, Asia holds the country with the highest `gdpPercap` by far. Almost all other outliers are roughly at or below 15,000 for their GDP per capita. However, the outlier in Asia has a GDP per capita of well over 90,000--an over six-fold increase. It is interesting to notice that every continent minus Oceania has outliers. Another thing of note is that Oceania, Africa and the Americas have the least boxplot body variation while the body of the Asia and Europe boxplots have a much bigger main box. This is indicative that there is a wider, but more even spread of `gdpPercap` in both Asia and Europe (Europe more so), while the spread of the `gdpPercap` in the other three continents are rather centralized.

-   When digging further into the data, it is discovered that Oceania only contains two different countries of analysis; thus, there can be no outliers in the Oceania boxplot as only two countries are considered. Comparatively, it is easier for the other continents to have outliers as Africa includes 52 countries, Asia 33, the Americas 25, and Europe 30. Note that this data could not be determined by the boxplot alone

**Difficulties & Approaches**:

-   One of the main difficulties was just trying to figure out how to present data in a way that could include and show the outliers of different countries in each continent. Using a bar chart of line graph would not easily show the outliers, a scatterplot would be too busy, and a density plot simply did not work. Thus, my approach was to use a boxplot as it would show the median, and the first and third quartiles as well as include outliers. This graph is not perfect as the outliers majorly skew the scale so the boxplot bodies cannot be analyzed well; however, it is better than many other graph options. An additional difficulty with this graph is that you cannot tell what countries the outliers belong to, so in q3, I will work to identify the outliers and plot with them in q4.

### **q3** You should have found *at least* three outliers in q2 (but possibly many more!). Identify those outliers (figure out which countries they are).

```{r q3-task}
## TASK: Identify the outliers from q2
gdpPercap_outliers <- 
  gapminder %>%                          # load gapminder
  filter(year == year_min) %>%           # filter the year to only be year == min
  group_by(continent) %>%                # group by continents so it's continent outliers
  do({
    stats <- boxplot.stats(.$gdpPercap)  # Compute boxplot stats for gdpPercap
    out_vals <- stats$out                # Identify outlier values
    filter(., gdpPercap %in% out_vals)   # check what values of out_vals match gdpPercap and filter
  })
gdpPercap_outliers
```

**Observations**:

-   Identify the outlier countries from q2
    -   The outliers in q2 are Angola, Gabon, South Africa, Canada, the United States, Venezuela, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Switzerland.
    -   Kuwait is the largest outlier in Asia with the GDP per capita of 108,381.353. Due to the way I coded for the outliers, I made sure that I found the outlier for each continent, not the whole dataset. This is important as if I had only looked at outliers for the whole dataset, it is unlikely that any of the African country outliers and even Venezuela would have been considered outliers, and Oceania countries (due to its high GDP per capita) would have been included despite not being outliers. That is, the African country outliers are between 3520.61 and 4725.296 and Venezuela has a GDP per capita of 7689.80. All other outliers start at 9867.085 and are generally higher. Thus, it is immensely important to `group_by` by continent.

```{r}
# bp_stats <-  boxplot.stats(             ##Does outliers for the whole dataset, not just by continent
#   (gapminder %>% 
#      filter(year == year_min) %>% 
#   )
#   $gdpPercap
#   )
# outliers <- bp_stats$out
# print(outliers)
# 
# gapminder %>%
#   filter(year == year_min) %>% 
#   filter(gdpPercap %in% outliers)
```

*Hint*: For the next task, it's helpful to know a ggplot trick we'll learn in an upcoming exercise: You can use the `data` argument inside any `geom_*` to modify the data that will be plotted *by that geom only*. For instance, you can use this trick to filter a set of points to label:

```{r layer-filter}
## NOTE: No need to edit, use ideas from this in q4 below
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == max(year)) %>%

  ggplot(aes(continent, lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = . %>% filter(country %in% c("United Kingdom", "Japan", "Zambia")),
    mapping = aes(color = country),
    size = 2
  )
```

### **q4** Create a plot similar to yours from q2 studying both `year_min` and `year_max`. Find a way to highlight the outliers from q3 on your plot *in a way that lets you identify which country is which*. Compare the patterns between `year_min` and `year_max`.

*Hint*: We've learned a lot of different ways to show multiple variables; think about using different aesthetics or facets.

```{r q4-task}
## TASK: Create a visual of gdpPercap vs continent
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == year_min | year == year_max) %>% 
  mutate(continent = fct_reorder(continent, gdpPercap)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(
     data = . %>% filter(country %in% c("Angola", "Gabon", "South Africa", "Canada", "United States", "Venezuela", "Bahrain", "Kuwait", "Switzerland")),
     mapping = aes(color = country),
     size = 2
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  labs(title = "GDP Per Capita vs. Continent in 1952 and 2007")
```

**Observations**:

-   Between 1952 and 2007 there was a large amount of growth in the GDP per capita for most continents. All of the main bodies/boxes in the boxplots have grown–meaning there is a more consistent wider spread of the GDP per capita. This is likely due to the development of countries and the greater level of introduction of technologies, access to food, water, shelter and more. We see this in all countries, but especially in Asia and Europe. It is important to note that while many continents had an increase in the size of their overall box, only some had a large shift in their median. Specifically, when looking at Africa and Asia, there was a very limited shift in their median GDP per capita. While both countries increased their median slightly, they both follow a trend where they have a much longer upper whisker and Q3 but a very low median. Comparatively, the Americas, Europe and Oceania all shifted their medians up quite significantly. Overarchingly, the trend of continent medians was the same in 1952 and 2007. That is, Africa has the lowest median GDP per capita, then Asia, then the Americas, then Europe, and lastly, Oceania has the highest. However, in 1952 compared to 2007 the median of one continent what generally higher than the Q3 of another country, this is not the case in 2007 as there is much more variability.
-   When looking out outliers, there are some pretty consistent outliers between 1952 and 2007, but some have become more "normal." For example, Canada and the United States are still outliers for the Americas, but Kuwait, which once had a GDP per capita of over 100,000 is now on the end of the whisker for Asia. Largely, the outliers remained on the high end of the continent's GDP per capita. The main difference in outliers between 1952 and 2007 is the introduction of a few more outliers in 2007.

# Your Own EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Now it's your turn! We just went through guided EDA considering the GDP per capita at two time points. You can continue looking at outliers, consider different years, repeat the exercise with `lifeExp`, consider the relationship between variables, or something else entirely.

### **q5** Create *at least* three new figures below. With each figure, try to pose new questions about the data.

```{r q5-task1}
gdpPercap_outliers <- 
  gapminder %>%                                     
  filter(year == year_max | year == 2002) %>%        
  group_by(continent, year) %>%                       
  do({
    stats <- boxplot.stats(.$gdpPercap)                
    out_vals <- stats$out                           
    filter(., gdpPercap %in% out_vals)                 
  })

gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2002 | year == year_max) %>% 
  mutate(continent = fct_reorder(continent, gdpPercap)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = gdpPercap_outliers,
    mapping = aes(color = country),
    size = 2
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  labs(title = "GDP Per Capita vs. Continent in 2002 and 2007")
```

-   I chose to do a graph comparing 2002 to 2007 GDP per capita in continents while coding the outliers per country to see if there was any large amount of change within five years for GDP per capita. Thus, my question posed was "Is there a a notable change in 5 years for continent's GDP per capita?"
-   Overarchingly, I would express that there is notable visual change in GDP per capita within some continents and countries. This is most notable in the continents of the Americas, Europe, and Oceania and in the shift of whisker size of Asia, the Americas and Europe. Looking at the whiskers first, the upper whisker of Asia and Q3 appear to elongate – meaning there is a greater level of variation within the continent for GDP per capita. The same can be said for the Americas where both the upper and lower whisker grew, with larger growth seen on the upper whisker. Secondly, when looking at the expansion of box size and shift in medians we can look to the Americas, Europe and Oceania. All three countries had the size of their box grow, indicating a larger expansion of variation, and all three had their medians shift upwards, indicating that the continent's overall GDP per capita increased. These trends indicate that the GDP per capita of the globe may be increasing as well. When looking to outliers we generally see consistent growth with some exceptions. For example, both the United States and Canada have continued to shift their GDP per capita upwards, while the outlier in 2002 Puerto Rico has disappeared in 2007--this could indicate a downwards shift in the economy, but more data on the specific economic status and circumstances of Puerto Rico would be needed to ensure this.
-   As explored in the prior EDA of GDP per capita and continent, a trend where Africa and Asia, have a very limited shift in their median GDP per capita. Further, they both continue to follow a trend where they have a much longer upper whisker and Q3 but a very low median. Comparatively, the Americas, Europe and Oceania all shifted their medians up notably. Additionally, the Americas and Oceania continue to have their median roughly in the middle of their boxplot, while Europe has its median shifted to the upper half of its boxplot body.

```{r q5-task2}
## TASK: Your first graph
lifeExp_outliers <- 
  gapminder %>%                                      # load gapminder
  filter(year == year_max | year == year_min) %>%    # filter the year to only be year == max OR year == min
  group_by(continent, year) %>%                      # group by continents and years so it's continent and year outliers
  do({
    stats <- boxplot.stats(.$lifeExp)                # Compute boxplot stats for lifeExp
    out_vals <- stats$out                            # Identify outlier values
    filter(., lifeExp %in% out_vals)                 # check what values of out_vals match lifeExp and filter
  })

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == year_min | year == year_max) %>%
  mutate(continent = fct_reorder(continent, lifeExp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent, lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = lifeExp_outliers,                                                         
    mapping = aes(color = country),
    size = 2
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy vs. Continent in 1952 and 2007")
```

-   I chose to compare the life expectancy in continents in 1952 to 2007 while coding the outliers per country to see if there was any consistency. Thus, my question posed was "How does life expectancy change in each continent between 1952 and 2007?"
-   Life expectancy changes drastically in every single continent from 1952 to 2007. All continents (Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe and Oceania) all have a large shift in their median to a much higher value. Both 1952 and 2007 show the same continent ranking based on median life expectancy: Africa has the lowest median life expectancy, than Asia, then the Americas, then Europe, then Oceania with the highest median. It should be noted that this is the same order as median GDP per capita. This could be indicative of increased money leading to easier access to healthcare, technology and basic resources. The whiskers and box sizes of Asia, the Americas and Europe all decrease between 1952 and 2007. This indicates that there is less variance in the life expectancy between different countries. However, we see the opposite when looking at Africa and Oceania. While both countries increased their median life expectancy, the box size and whiskers increased (slightly for Oceania and largely for Africa). This indicates a greater level of variance in life expectancy between countries. For Africa specifically, due to its low life expectancy, this could be due to the wide range of developing countries in Africa and a lack of access to resources. The outliers between 1952 and 2007 are not consistent and their reason for being so low or higher is not determinable by this dataset. While we could look to things like GDP per capita, having more data on the political, social and climate situations of these countries could help us solve this.

```{r q5-task3}
pop_outliers <- 
  gapminder %>%                                      # load gapminder
  filter(year == 1977 | year == 1952) %>%            # filter the year to only be year == max OR year == min
  group_by(continent, year) %>%                      # group by continents and years so it's continent and year outliers
  do({
    stats <- boxplot.stats(.$pop)                    # Compute boxplot stats for pop
    out_vals <- stats$out                            # Identify outlier values
    filter(., pop %in% out_vals)                     # check what values of out_vals match pop and filter
  })

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952 | year == 1977) %>%
  mutate(continent = fct_reorder(continent, pop)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent, pop)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = pop_outliers,                                                             
    mapping = aes(color = country),
    size = 2
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  labs(title = "Population vs. Continent in 1952 and 2007") +
  scale_y_log10()
```

-   I chose to compare the population in continents from 1952 to 1977 while coding the outliers per country to see if there was any consistency. Thus, my question posed was "How does population change in each continent between 1952 and 1977?"
-   While this representation is not amazing, due to the plethora of countries and large outliers, it was the best graph to represent population vs. continent. I decided to change the y-axis scale to a log ten scale to show the variation within countries. However, this limits the extremities of many of the outliers and makes some lower outliers appear that are not actually outliers. The overall answer is that the median population increases some over the span of 25 years; however, the majority of growth is seen in outliers, not the continent's median itself. Over the span of 25 years, Africa remained the continent with the smallest median population, then the Americas, then Oceania, then Europe and then Asia. When thinking intuitively, this may appear to be surprising as a few countries in America definitely have a larger population than that of Oceania. We see this when looking at outliers, in both 1952 and 1977, Mexico, Brazil and the United States all had a higher population than Oceania. Thus, we see that in specifics, country-to-country level comparison may be better than continent-to-continent as there is a large level of variation in population and sizing of different countries and their populations The main country we see an increase in variation of population size is in Asia–this could be due to more countries growing their population sizes. Additionally, Asia has the most notable outliers – India and China – with the outliers being far above the populations of other countries and the medians of all continents. Thus, while this graph does not tell us too much about continent trends, it tells a lot about outlier trends and gives ideas for future country-to-country comparison.
